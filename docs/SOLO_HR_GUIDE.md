**Solution:** 
1. Export to Excel
2. Sort by "Days Until Expiry"
3. Focus on <30 days first
4. Create renewal calendar in Excel

### "I can't find a feature"
**Solution:** Check if it's been simplified/removed. See main README for full feature list.

## Pro Tips for Solo HR

1. **Excel is Your Friend**  
   Export everything, analyze offline. The portal tracks, Excel analyzes.

2. **Set Reminders**  
   - Weekly: Check compliance (Friday)
   - Monthly: Export all lists (1st of month)
   - Quarterly: Review all employee records

3. **Focus on UAE Compliance**  
   Visa/EID/Medical/Contract expiry are legal requirements. Everything else can wait.

4. **Use CSV Exports**  
   Every list view has an export button. Use it!

5. **Keep It Simple**  
   Don't try to use every feature. Stick to what you need.
